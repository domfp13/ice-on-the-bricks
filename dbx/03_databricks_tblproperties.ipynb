    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `TBLPROPERTY` in Delta Lake represents a **configuration decision** and **ongoing maintenance burden** that Snowflake eliminates through automatic management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storage Management:** Databricks requires VACUUM scheduling and monitoring; Snowflake handles automatically\n",
    "2. **Performance Optimization:** Databricks requires OPTIMIZE commands and trade-off decisions; Snowflake auto-clusters\n",
    "3. **Concurrency Control:** Databricks uses optimistic locking with retry logic; Snowflake uses lock-based queuing\n",
    "4. **Statistics:** Databricks requires ANALYZE TABLE commands; Snowflake collects automatically\n",
    "5. **Total Operational Overhead:** 15-30 hours/month compute + significant engineering time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competitive Positioning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| When Customer Says... | Effective Response |\n",
    "|----------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| \"Databricks is cheaper\" | \"Have you included maintenance compute costs and engineering time?\" |\n",
    "| \"We like open formats\" | \"How much time do you spend on VACUUM and OPTIMIZE?\" |\n",
    "| \"Delta Lake is flexible\" | \"What's your retry logic for ConcurrentAppendException?\" |\n",
    "| \"We need the data lakehouse\" | \"How many of your tables actually need ML vs pure SQL?\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Databricks excels at unified data engineering + ML + SQL. Snowflake excels at zero-maintenance SQL analytics. Position based on customer needs, not features."
